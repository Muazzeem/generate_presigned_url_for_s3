### AWS Lambda Functions

This folder contains the source code for the AWS Lambda functions used in the CareerTutor project.

#### get_signed_url.py

A presigned URL is generated by an AWS user who has access to the object. 
The generated URL is then given to the unauthorized user. The presigned URL can be used
to download the object.

#### handler.py

The function takes an event containing user information (email, name, and comment) 
and writes this data as an item into a specified DynamoDB table.  
The response includes the DynamoDB `put_item` response and appropriate CORS headers to allow
cross-origin requests.


## Deployment

1. **Configure AWS Credentials:** Ensure your AWS credentials are configured correctly.  You can do this using the AWS CLI or environment variables.

2. **Create DynamoDB Table:** Create the `usersTable` DynamoDB table if it doesn't already exist.  Make sure the primary key is appropriately defined.

3. **Package and Deploy:**  You can use the AWS Serverless Application Model (SAM) or a similar tool to package and deploy the Lambda function.  A basic example using the AWS CLI might look like this (replace placeholders):

   ```bash
   aws lambda create-function \
       --function-name add-user-comment \
       --runtime python3.9 \
       --role <your-lambda-execution-role-arn> \
       --handler lambda_function.lambda_handler \
       --zip-file fileb://lambda_function.zip \
       --region ap-southeast-1
